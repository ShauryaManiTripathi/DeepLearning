    "Great question! The ability of `tf.GradientTape` to determine that the loss is a function of the weights (or any other variable) comes from how TensorFlow manages its computational graph and the automatic differentiation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TensorFlow's Eager Execution**:\n",
    "   - In TensorFlow 2.x, eager execution is enabled by default. This means that operations are executed immediately, and TensorFlow constructs a dynamic computation graph as you run your code.\n",
    "   - When you perform operations on tensors, TensorFlow keeps track of the operations and their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recording Operations**:\n",
    "   - When you create a `tf.GradientTape()` context, it starts recording all operations on any `tf.Variable` (like `weights`) that are used to compute the output (like `loss`).\n",
    "   - Every time you perform an operation on a variable, TensorFlow knows that this variable contributed to the result of that operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using the Tape**:\n",
    "   - After you've computed the loss, you call `tape.gradient(loss, weights)`.\n",
    "   - At this point, TensorFlow looks back through the recorded operations in the tape. It tracks how `loss` was computed and identifies which variables were involved in those calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a simplified example to clarify this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize weights\n",
    "weights = tf.Variable(3.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Target value\n",
    "target = 5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gradient tape context\n",
    "with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n",
    "    # Compute loss as a function of weights\n",
    "    loss = (weights - target) ** 2  # Loss depends on weights\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute gradients\n",
    "gradient = tape.gradient(loss, weights)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weight Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `weights` is defined as a `tf.Variable`, which TensorFlow will track for gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Inside the `with` block, the loss is calculated. The expression `(weights - target) ** 2` involves `weights`.\n",
    "   - TensorFlow knows that `loss` is dependent on `weights` because it records the operation that computes `loss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradient Calculation**:\n",
    "   - When you call `tape.gradient(loss, weights)`, TensorFlow checks its recorded operations to see how `loss` was calculated.\n",
    "   - It finds that the computation `(weights - target) ** 2` directly involves `weights`, thus allowing it to compute the derivative of `loss` with respect to `weights`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Aspect\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying mathematical principle is based on the chain rule of calculus. When you compute a function of functions (like `loss = f(weights)`), the derivative of `loss` with respect to `weights` can be found using:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\frac{d\\text{loss}}{d\\text{weights}} = \\frac{d}{d\\text{weights}}((\\text{weights} - \\text{target})^2) = 2(\\text{weights} - \\text{target}) \\cdot 1\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Graph**: The tape records operations dynamically, enabling it to keep track of dependencies.\n",
    "- **Automatic Differentiation**: When you request the gradient, TensorFlow uses the chain rule to compute how changes in `weights` affect `loss`.\n",
    "- **Variables Tracking**: It specifically tracks `tf.Variable` objects, ensuring that any operation involving these variables is recorded for gradient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system allows TensorFlow to efficiently compute gradients without manual differentiation, making it powerful for optimization tasks. If you have further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask!'\n"

    "## Original (Incorrect) Version\n",

    "In the original version with `matmul`, the computation was:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y_pred = tf.matmul(tf.reshape(x, (-1, 1)), tf.reshape(weights, (1, -1)))\n",

    "\n",
    "1. x = [x₁, x₂, x₃]\n",

    "\n",
    "## What Went Wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient formula itself is actually correct in both cases. The problem lies in how TensorFlow computes and applies this gradient due to the different tensor shapes and operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the original version, `weights` is a 1x1 matrix `[[w]]`, and `y_pred` is a 3x1 matrix `[[w*x₁], [w*x₂], [w*x₃]]`.\n",
    "   - TensorFlow computes the gradient with respect to this 1x1 matrix.\n",
    "   - The reshaping and `matmul` operations introduce additional complexity in the computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the correct version, `weights` is a scalar `w`, and `y_pred` is a 1D tensor `[w*x₁, w*x₂, w*x₃]`.\n",
    "   - TensorFlow computes the gradient with respect to this scalar.\n",
    "   - The element-wise multiplication simplifies the computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference is in how TensorFlow handles the gradient computation and application for these different tensor shapes and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the given values: x = [1, 2, 3], y_true = [2, 4, 6], and suppose w = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Original version:\n",
    "y_pred = [[1.5], [3.0], [4.5]]\n",
    "L = (1/3) * ((2 - 1.5)² + (4 - 3.0)² + (6 - 4.5)²) = 0.5833\n",
    "∂L/∂w = (2/3) * (1.5*(1² + 2² + 3²) - (2*1 + 4*2 + 6*3)) = -1.1667\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct version:\n",
    "y_pred = [1.5, 3.0, 4.5]\n",
    "L = (1/3) * ((2 - 1.5)² + (4 - 3.0)² + (6 - 4.5)²) = 0.5833\n",
    "∂L/∂w = (2/3) * (1.5*(1² + 2² + 3²) - (2*1 + 4*2 + 6*3)) = -1.1667\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradients are numerically the same, but the way TensorFlow applies them differs due to the different tensor shapes and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental mathematical gradient formula was correct in both cases. The issue arose from how TensorFlow interpreted and applied this gradient due to the different tensor shapes and operations used in the original versus the correct version. The `matmul` and reshaping operations in the original version created a more complex computational graph, leading to incorrect weight updates despite the gradient formula being mathematically equivalent."
